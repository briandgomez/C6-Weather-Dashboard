# Description 
The following repository contains code for a weather dashboard. As shown in the image below the weather dashboard displays important information such as the current date, temperature, wind speed, humidity, and UV Index for a particular city. Users are able to type in any name of a city in the United States and the cities information will be saved as a button for future use. The information displays the current date as well as for the next 5 days. This dashboard makes it easier for users to get information about the weather because only the most important information is displayed. It also makes searching for a specific city easier with the automatic save feature.
